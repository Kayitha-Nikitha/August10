Hi All 
Topics to cover on Monday 

C : Control Structures - Loops- for - while , brk , continue , if - if-else
DS : Stacks , Queues

Assignment : 
Loops:
1.      Write a program to print the below pattern using while loop:
     /\                                                                                                                       

    /  \                                                                                                                      

   /    \                                                                                                                     

  /      \

2. Switch case 
     take 2 double integers and an i/p from user :
	 if "a" , add the integers and print "sum is .." ,
	 if "s" , subtract the integers and print "diff is .." ,
	 default case : print "defaut case- noaction"

Break/Continue:
3. wap to calculate the sum of numbers (10 numbers max)
  a) If the user enters a negative number, the loop terminates
 b) If the user enters a negative number, it's not added to the result
 ex   a: user enters 
  1 - add to sum , 20, add to sum , 0 - terminate the loop and sum  should be printed 
  ex b : user enters  1 - add to sum , 20 , add to sum , -1 - dont add to sum - go to next iteration - print sum 
 

4.     wap to print  The number of consecutive same elements in the sequence should be same as the value.
Example: 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 is valid (input is 4 )              
1 2  3 3 3  is invalid. (input is 3) 

If....Else:
5.Write a c program to print all even and odd numbers btwn 1-100  
o/p : even numbers are : 2,4,6,....100
      odd numbers are : 1,3,5,.....99
DS:
6.create a stack and push 1,2,3 and pop once - print after even push and pop
